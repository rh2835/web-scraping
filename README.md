# web-scraping
This repository contains Natural Language Processing projects which data comes from web scraping using Python.<br/>
First, I used Python packages 'requests' and 'BeautifulSoup' to gain novels' data from Project Gutenburg(http://www.gutenberg.org/). 
Then, I used Python package 'nltk' for furthur NLP analysis.
